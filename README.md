# mariafretza_portfolio
This is my portfolio!

Static multi-page portfolio scaffold for Maria Fretza.

Pages included:
- index.html (Home)
- digital-marketing.html
- design.html
- content-writing.html
- web-dev.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- case-studies.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/site.js
- assets/images (placeholder folder)

Notes
- Hero copy and positioning set to your provided lines.
- Primary CTA: "View my work" (links to Case Studies).
- Secondary CTA / header CTA: "Contact me".
- Accessible theme toggle (light/dark) persists preference in localStorage.
- This scaffold is intentionally simple so you can review content and structure. When ready, I can convert to Astro and wire markdown-based case studies.
